    To perform an action only the first time your app runs in Android, you can use SharedPreferences to store a flag indicating whether the app has run before. Here's a step-by-step guide:

    Steps:
    Check if the app is running for the first time: Use SharedPreferences to look for a specific key (e.g., "isFirstRun").
    Perform the action if it's the first run: If the key is not set, execute the desired action and then set the flag in SharedPreferences to mark that the action has been completed.
    Skip the action on subsequent runs: On subsequent app launches, the key will be set, so the action won't execute again.
    Example Code:
    java
    Copy code
    import android.content.SharedPreferences;
    import android.os.Bundle;
    import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
        @Override
        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

            // Access SharedPreferences
            SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences("AppPreferences", MODE_PRIVATE);
            boolean isFirstRun = sharedPreferences.getBoolean("isFirstRun", true);

            if (isFirstRun) {
                // Perform the action you want to execute only on the first run
                performFirstRunAction();

                // Update the flag so this block won't execute again
                SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();
                editor.putBoolean("isFirstRun", false);
                editor.apply();
            }
        }

        private void performFirstRunAction() {
            // Action to perform on the first run
            System.out.println("This runs only on the first launch!");
            // Add your code here, e.g., showing a welcome screen or tutorial
        }
    }
    Key Points:
    File Name: "AppPreferences" is the name of the preferences file. You can change it to any suitable name.
    Flag Name: "isFirstRun" is the key that tracks if the app has run before.
    Persistence: The value is stored in SharedPreferences and persists until the app is uninstalled or the data is cleared.
    This approach ensures the action executes only once, regardless of how many times the app is restarted.
